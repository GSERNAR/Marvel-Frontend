            When bleeding, a characterâ€™s defense lowers by 1 and takes 1d6 damage each turn. If a character is hit while bleeding, the bleeding has 50% chance of getting worse, which will add another 1d6 damage each turn. This status will last until a long rest is taken, or until the open wound is either covered with a bandage or cauterized. Characters with lesser healing factor can cure from bleeding with a Durability check of 15 and characters with a regenerative healing factor can cure with a Durability check of 12. If a character gets hit and obtains 6d6 of bleeding it will die of blood loss.
