                While frozen, a character canâ€™t attempt any action, and its Speed is 0. Every turn on this status, the character takes 1d8 cold damage. To break free, the player must save to 17 Strength or cast a fire attack. All attacks against this character are thrown in advantage, but they have a 50% chance of letting the frozen character free.
