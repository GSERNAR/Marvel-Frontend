        While frozen, a character canâ€™t attempt any action, and its Speed is 0.
        Every turn on this status, the character takes 1d12 cold damage. To
        break free, the player must cast a fire attack or save to 17 Strength at the end of their turn.
        All attacks against this character are thrown in advantage, but they
        have a 50% chance of letting the frozen character free.
        Any character who is set free from the frozen status will get soaked.
