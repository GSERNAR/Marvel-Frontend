        Some actions require concentration for them to be executed.
        A character that requires concentration for these actions can move but
        they canâ€™t attempt any other kind of action while concentrating. A
        character that requires high concentration cannot move while
        concentrating. If a character gets attacked while concentrating, it will
        lose its concentration.
