        While petrified, a character canâ€™t attempt any action, its Speed is
        0 and cannot see anything either. To break free, the player must save to
        19 Strength at the end of their turn. All attacks against this character are thrown in advantage,
        but they have a 50% chance of letting the petrified character free.
        However, there is 5% chance of an attack breaking the rock, killing
        the petrified character. If a character stay petrified for more than 10
        turns, they die by suffocation.
