For example, hiding from another character requires the skill âstealthâ, so the user must throw 1d20 and add the stealth skill value to the dice result. The GM will decide the check required for the action to be successful according to the circumstances, but the most basic successful action requires a result of 10.",
  "Victoria2": "Special actions can be completely different depending on the character youâre playing.

When a battle starts, you can increase your power meter in 1d4. Every long rest, your power meter fully recharges. Powers are classified according to a level: LV1 powers, LV2 powers, LV3 powers, LV4 powers, special powers, and Ultimate powers.",
  "Powers2": "Powers can also vary in Psychic, Melee, Magic, or Energy. This indicates the damage bonus. All damage done by psychic attacks will have + Wisdom damage. However, some Psychic powers donât do any damage. All damage done by melee attacks will have + Strength damage (not to be confused with the melee stat). All damage done by energy attacks will have + Energy Projection damage. All damage done by Magic attacks will have + magic damage. There are also Unique powers which bonus is determined on the powerâs description. Support powers donât do any damage but have special effects that will aid in battle.

  "Lifting": "Lifting Objects",
  "LiftingDesc": "Just like other special actions, to lift a specific weight, a character must throw 1d20, with the bonus being the Strength stat. Since some characters are stronger than others, the strength stat indicates how much a character can lift. The Strength stat is measured in a range from 0 to 8. A character can attempt to lift something one scale higher, however, that throw is done in disadvantage. On the other side, a character that attempts to lift a weight that is one scale below will throw his dice with advantage. A character will always succeed lifting a weight that is two scales lower. A character will always fail trying to lift a weight that is two scales higher. This table indicates how much can a character lift according to its strength stat.",
  "Throw": "Throwing Objects",
  "ThrowDesc": "Just like with other special actions, to throw different kinds of objects, a character must throw 1d20. For the character to be able to throw an object, he must be able to lift it. To throw an object to the exact place you want you must get at least a 17 throw in strength or marksman. If the object weights more than half of what the character is capable of lifting, the strength stat must be used. If not, the marksman stat can be used. For every point from the playerâs throw that is below 17, the object lands 5 ft away from the desired spot, closer to the character. This table indicates the maximum distance a character can throw an object:",
  "Crush": "Crushing Damage",
  "CrushDesc": "When falling objects crush or fall on a certain character they do an amount of damage according to the weight of the specific object and the Durability stat of the character being damaged. Additionally the damage is increased in 1d4 for each 10 ft of height from which the object has fallen. If the amounf of damage dices is 5 or higher the victim must achieve a durability throw of 15 or it will fall prone. If the amount is higher than 7 dices the victim will always fall prone.",
  "Traffic": "Traffic Collisions",
  "TrafficDesc": "When riding a vehicle, if it crashes a person, the victim will receive damage according to the type of vehicle, its speed and the victimâs Durability stat. To avoid being crashed as a pedestrian, you must get an agility check of 12. This table indicates the amount of damage dices that the crash will deal to a victim. However, the dice varies depending on the vehicle: d6 is used for motorcycles, d8 for cars, d10 for busses and trucks, d20 for bigger vehicles.",
  "TrafficDesc2": "When driving, to avoid crashing with another vehicle, you must pass a check of 12 on the respective vehicle driving skill. If failed the damage will be calculated adding half of the damage that a crash will do depending on your vehicle and its speed to the amount of damage dealt by the other vehicle according to its type and speed, and then it will get reduced in an amount of dices equal to the durability of your vehicle. This damage will be dealt to both driver and vehicle.",
  "Jump": "Jumping",
  "Jump1": "Just like other special actions, to perform a vertical jump, a character must throw 1d20. Since some characters are stronger than others, the strength stat indicates how much a character can jump vertically. The Strength stat is measured in a range from 0 to 8. A character can attempt to jump a height one scale higher, however, that throw is done in disadvantage. On the other side, a character that attempts to jump a height one scale below will throw his dice with advantage. A character will always succeed jumping up a height that is two scales lower and will always fail trying to jump a height that is two scales higher. This table indicates how high a character can jump according to its strength stat.",
  "Jump2": "Just like with other special actions, to perform a horizontal jump, a character must throw 1d20. Since some characters are stronger than others, the strength stat indicates how much a character can jump horizontally. The Strength stat is measured in a range from 0 to 8. A character can attempt to jump a distance one scale higher, however, that throw is done in disadvantage. On the other side, a character that attempts to jump a distance one scale below will throw his dice with advantage. A character will always succeed jumping a distance that is two scales lower. A character will always fail trying to jump a distance that is two scales higher. This table indicates how long a character can jump according to its strength stat.",
  "Jump3": "A horizontal jump can also be attempted with acrobatics but to a lower degree. The scaling works the same than with the strength stat. This table indicates how long a character can jump according to its acrobatics skill.",
  "Jump4": "A character can attempt to jump both, vertically and horizontally, he just need one check for both vertical and horizontal movement",
  "Break": "Breaking or Bending Materials",
  "BreakDesc": "Just like with other special actions, to break or bend different kinds of materials, a character must throw 1d20. Since some characters are stronger than others, the strength stat indicates what kind of materials a character can break or bend. The Strength stat is measured in a range from 0 to 8. A character can attempt to break an object categorized one scale higher, however, that throw is done in disadvantage. On the other side, a character that attempts to break a material categorized one scale below will throw his dice with advantage. A character will always succeed breaking materials that are two scales lower. A character will always fail trying to break materials that are two scales higher. This table indicates which materials a character can break or bend according to its strength stat:",
  "Fly": "Flying",
  "Fly1": "A character with the flight skill can move in the air. Every character that can fly can attempt to do it without doing any kind of check. However, when flying, if the character is required to do any kind of maneuver, a check determined by the GM may be required. In this case, the flight skill will work as a bonus, just like with common actions. The flight speed is determined by the flight skill. The flight skill is scaled from 1 to 9.", 
  "Fly2": "In battle, a character that can fly can move both vertically and horizontally. Their movement speed while flying is determined by this table:",
  "Fly3": "If a character gets hit while flying, it must make a Durability check higher to the attackers throw. If failed, the character must throw the same dice used by the attacker to do damage, to determine the distance in ft from which the flying character will fall. If after falling this distance, the flying character doesnât touch the ground, the character will regain stability and will keep flying. If a flying character falls to the ground, it will receive damage equal to 1d4 multiplied for every 10 ft of height. If the character faints, falls asleep, gets paralyzed or frozen while flying it will fall to the ground, receiving damage as described before. If a flying character gets stunned, it can attempt a Durability throw of 14, to avoid falling. If succeeded, the character will not fall but it will need to use that turn to descend. Every turn that the character is flying, and it's still stunned, this process is repeated until the character lands, falls to the ground, or sets free from the stunning effect.",
  "SpeedFlight": "Speed Flight",
  "SpeedFlightDesc": "A character that can fly can attempt to make a speed flight, to move faster in the air both vertically and horizontally. However, Speed Flight canât be used in battle. The flying speed will be determined by the flight skill.",
  "Custom": "Custom Actions",
  "CustomDesc": "During a play session, a player can come up with different kind of actions that are not described on the roleplaying actions section or as a power, skill, or ability for a certain character. These are custom actions. On these situations, the GM may or may not allow the player to perform given action, and if the custom action is permitted, he can ask for a certain dice check according to how difficult may it be to perform that specific custom action for the playerâs character. If the playerâs character is an already existing Marvel character, the GM may consider if that character has performed that custom action before in some media, or how hard would it be for a that character to perform this custom action. If the playerâs character is a custom character, the GM may evaluate the characterâs powers, stats, skills, and abilities to stablish if the character can perform given custom action and the dice check necessary for that action to be successful, according to how hard may that action be for this custom character. Custom actions can also be performed in battle, and they can also rest power points if the GM considers it would do so. ",
  "Popularity": "Popularity",
  "PopularityDesc": "Every character has an initial amount of popularity points, representing how much the character is known by the public in the entire universe. These initial popularity points are determined by the GM, according to the campaign or the character that is going to be played. For every public action, a character can gain popularity points depending on how much attention that action creates. These points determine how civilians or certain NPCs will interact with the character. The higher these points are, the most possible is that the civilians will recognize your character, the lower these points are, the more indifferent they will become towards given character. Itâs very hard to lose popularity points, but if you enter long times of inactivity, itâs possible that the public may start to forget you if your popularity points are below 400. This scale indicates the proportion of the popularity you gain with these points:",
  "Reputation": "Reputation",
  "ReputationDesc": "Every character has an initial amount of Reputation points, representing how good or bad is the opinion of civilians about that character. These initial popularity points are determined by the GM, according to the campaign or character that is going to be played. For every public action, a character can gain or lose Reputation points depending on how the public perceives that action. These points determine how civilians and certain NPCs will interact with the character. The higher these points are, the better response will the civilians show, the lower these points are, the more hostile or afraid they will become towards that character. These points go from a scale from -100 to 100. ",
  "PublicImage": "Public Image",
  "PublicImageDesc": "Sometimes public opinion is not equal to the authoritiesâ opinion about a certain character, meaning that even if a character is popular among civilians, it can be considered a public menace or vice versa. A characterâs public image determines how good or bad is the relationship of a specific characters with the authorities. Every character can be perceived in one of these different categories.",
  "Identity": "Identity",
  "IdentityDesc": "Some heroes want to keep their hero and their personal life separated, thatâs why they chose to hide their government name from the public. You can have four types of identities in the game. Public Identity is when your alter ego is known by the government and the public. An Identity Known by the Authorities (KBA) is when your alter ego is known only by the government but not by the public. A Secret Identity is when your identity is not known by the government or the public. No dual identity is when you donât have an alter ego.",
  "Ranged": "Ranged Combat",
  "RangedDesc": "Ranged attacks are made at long distance, which means that the objective is out of the close combat range of the attacker. These attacks can be done with powers, weapons or even throwing certain objects. After the attacker throws the d20 dice, the defender can attempt an agility throw to evade the incoming projectile. If his agility throw is higher than the attackerâs throw (+the respective bonus) the projectile fails.",
  "Combos": "Combos",
  "CombosDesc": "When a character deals a normal attack successfully, they can attempt a combo. Each three levels a character gets one more attack for his combo, meaning every character unlocks their first extra attack at level 3. The maximum number of attacks of a combo are equal to the melee stat of a character. For example, Spider-Man has 4 melee, so he can attack up to 4 times, which includes the first successful attack. However, each combo attack will have 1 point less in its attack modifier. For the second attack of the combo, Spider-Man will only have 3 points in its melee bonus modifier. Then he can attempt a third attack, which will now have 1 melee bonus modifier. If Spider-Man attempts a fourth attack, it will now have no bonus in its melee throw, which will make this last hit of the combo harder to achieve. However, if every attack of a combo is successful, the victim will have 5 ft knockback and will have 30% chance of falling prone to opportunity attacks.",
  "Dodge": "Dodge",
  "DodgeDesc": "You can use a normal action to put yourself in dodge, which means that, for the next round, any attack attempted against you is thrown in disadvantage.",
  "Guard": "Guard",

  "Opportunity": "Opportunity Attacks",

  "Revive": "Revive",
  "ReviveDesc": "Every character with first aid or medicine can use their action to revive another character, which will give the fallen character advantage when making their saving throws. The medic must stay concentrated when reviving another character.",
  "Help": "Help",
  "HelpDesc": "You can use a normal action to aid another character when attempting an action. The character you help will gain advantage on the next check they perform, but the helping character must have the skill or ability required for the attempted check.",
  "Dash": "Dash",
  "DashDesc": "You can use a normal action to run at twice your speed.",
  "Telekinetic": "Telekinetic Attacks",
  "TelekineticDesc": "Telekinetic attacks are usually done with powers. After the attacker throws the d20 dice, the defender can attempt an agility throw to evade being caught by telekinesis. If their agility throw is higher than the attackerâs throw (+the respective bonus) the power fails.",
  "Radial": "Radial Attacks",
  "RadialDesc": "When a character throws a radial attack, every enemy caught within the radius must make an agility throw. If the victimâs throw is higher than the attackerâs throw, the power fails.",
  "Psychic": "Psychic Attacks",
  "PsychicDesc": "Psychic attacks are usually done with powers. After the attacker throws the d20 dice, the defender can attempt a wisdom throw to evade being damaged or charmed by the psychic attack. If their wisdom throw is higher than the attackerâs throw (+psychic or wisdom bonus) the power fails.",
  "Level": "Level Up",
  "LevelDesc": "Every battle gives experience to all characters. Every time a character levels up, it gains 10 hp and unlocks certain abilities or powers according to the characterâs sheet. On levels 10 and 20 it gains 20 HP.",
  "Critical": "Critical Hit",
  "CriticalDesc": "If a character or creature gets a natural 20 when throwing the check for attacking another character or creature it deals a critical hit. A critical hit always deals double damage.

  "Fail": "Failure",
  "FailDesc": "If a character gets 1 in their 1d20 check for any action, not only the action fails, but it produces a negative effect on the character which will be determined by the GM according to the circumstances.

If a character is hit while bleeding, the bleeding has 50% chance of getting worse, which will add another 1d6 damage each turn. This status will last until a long rest is taken, or until the open wound is either covered with a bandage or cauterized. Characters with lesser healing factor can cure from bleeding with a Durability check of 15 and characters with a regenerative healing factor can cure with a Durability check of 12. If a character gets hit and obtains 6d6 of bleeding it will die of blood loss.",
  "Blind": "Blinded",
